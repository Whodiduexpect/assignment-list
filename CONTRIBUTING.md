# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Assignment List.


### How can I help?

* Implementing features (the [feature tracker](https://github.com/Whodiduexpect/assignment-list/projects/1) is a good place to look for new features to implement)
* Fixing bugs (Github Issues is a good place to look)
* Correcting or clarifying the documentation
* Creating bug reports and feature requests through an [issue](https://github.com/Whodiduexpect/assignment-list/issues/new/choose)

# How to report a bug

Before reporting a bug:
1. Make sure that the issue is caused by Assignment List itself, and not one of its dependencies. For example, if the Student Vue data is incorrect, it is most likely the Student Vue Parser at fault. However, if you're unsure if the issue is caused by Assignment List or one of its dependencies, treat it as if it was an Assignment List issue.
2. Make sure that the "bug" that you are experiencing is a bug and not an error of incorrect installation. If you are having trouble getting Assignment List working, create an issue but don't label it a bug report.

To report a bug, create an issue and select the "Bug Report" template and fill out the different sections if applicable.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

To suggest a feature or enhancement, create a normal issue to suggest it. Once the feature or enhancement has been approved, it will be added to the [feature tracker](https://github.com/Whodiduexpect/assignment-list/projects/1), where you can check the progress of its implementation.


# Code Conventions
There are no strict rules or anything, just try to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds).
## Tests
Since I'm pretty sure nobody is going to give their credentials for tests, tests don't test the main functionality of Assignment List and are more used to make sure certain aspects still work (ex: the help screen). Even though the tests might not test that Assignment List is entirely working, try to test essential aspects manually, or have someone else test it for you.
