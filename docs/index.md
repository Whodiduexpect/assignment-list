# Assignment List

## What is Assignment List?

### The Premise

Assignment List was created because of Student Vue's lack of any organizational tools. In other services that handle assignments, like Google Classroom, for example, you have these organizational tools, for example, you can mark an assignment as complete, or you could also view to do assignments by the due date. However, Student Vue only gives you a calendar view of the assignments. You can't view them as a list, you can't see if their completed, you can only see the name of the assignments in a poorly made calendar view. This visibly makes Student View a bad choice for managing assignments. However, this doesn't stop school districts from using it as the primary way to manage assignments.

### What does Assignment List do to help?
Assignment List is a command-line tool that parses Student Vue, and lets you view them as a list with different list categories, like "current", "completed", or "past due". It lets you mark assignments as completed. It lets you add your assignments to the list. Of course, it's not magic, you won't see added assignments in Student Vue or your teachers won't see when you mark your assignments as done. All this information is stored in a file on your computer. However, this means that as Assignment List matures, new features can be added, like for example, the ability to schedule specific days to work on assignments.
